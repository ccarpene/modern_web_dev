## [0.4.0] - 2025-05-03

We included additional features and functionalities to our website, following our described user stories.

### Added

We have added an animated picture slideshow to our main page, highlighting different locations mentioned on our website. In addition, we have embedded interactive maps on certain webpages, in order to highlight the geographical locations of these places. Moreover, when a new user registers on our website, they will receive a 10% off coupon via email.
 
### Changed

Any links that redirect to external websites will now open in a separate tab, allowing the user to explore this external site while also remaining logged-in on our website. We also improved the appearance of our existing Authentication modules using CSS.

### Fixed

Once a user submits a comment on our main page, it will now appear in the list of existing suggestions in real-time. Previously, a newly submitted comment would not appear.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-04-02

We made our website more secure through the adding of authentication mechanisms.

### Added

We added login, register, and logout capabilities.
 
### Changed

Made some of our existing routing protected, so non-authenticated users would not be able to access all pages of the website.

### Fixed

Nothing.
 
## [0.2.0] - 2025-03-07

We transitioned from PREACT to REACT. 
 
### Added

We added routing for smoother transitions as the user puruses our website. 
 
### Changed

The "Return Home" feature on all webpages is now presented in a more appealing button. Moreover, we are storing our website data using a database (instead of a simple JSON).
   
### Fixed

Nothing.
 
## [0.1.0] - 2025-02-12

We took our existing website from Feature 2, built exclusively using HTML and CSS, and re-built it upon a PREACT framework. 
 
### Added

We added user interactivity to our website, including a comment section that will display your comment in real-time.
   
### Changed

Reorganized the elements of the website into a component-based design.
 
### Fixed

Nothing.
